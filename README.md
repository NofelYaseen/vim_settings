# VIM settings

Here is my vim configuration file and with some instructions/commands I use regularly. It's beginner friendly so feel free to copy.

## Instructions

### Update Vim
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/vim
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vim
```


Copy `vimrc` file to `$HOME`. Rename it to `.vimrc`. 
This file contains all the plugins and settings. It's good to learn how to edit this file.

`Vundle` is a plugin manager for vim.  
`Vundle` let's you specify a plugin in a number of formats, but my favorite allows you to grab plugins straight off of github, just specify the bundle in the following format:
```
Bundle 'githubUsername/repoName'
```

### Vundle setup instructions

```
mkdir .vim
cd .vim
mkdir bundle
cd bundle
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle
vim +PluginInstall +qall
cd YouCompleteMe
python install.py
```


## Commands

Install plugins from terminal: `vim +PluginInstall +qall`
